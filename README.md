This repo contains code for the final project I completed for a class called 'Data Mining'.
I took the class in fall of 2023. It was the 2nd class of 5 that is considered Ohio State's
'Certification in Practice of Data and Analytics'. In this project I import a baseball dataset,
explore it, and run a K-Means clustering analysis on it. The goal was to compare Cincinnati Reds
2023 regularly playing rookies and compare their offensive statistics to those of other rookie/team
pairs throughout the league.
